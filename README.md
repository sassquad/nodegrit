Bits of node for a knowledge share

These little code samples show what can be done with Node.js. I'm hoping to inject some humour into what I find to be a dry subject.

The accompanying slides (done with Google Slides) can be found here -https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yGMxtueSpwAj5lu6oeOITrQHkzgh5HDKSjXwzP9-N88/edit?usp=sharing

There are 4 samples:

* 2016 Simulator - a piece of fun command line stuff to demonstrate linking of files and use of NPM modules
* Bitbucket Snippets - taken from a tutorial (https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/11/scripting-with-node/), this code uploads snippets via Bitbucket's Snippet API (doesn't quite work, as requires OAuth)
* Simple Website - simple static website, done using Node.js core module functionality
* Express Website - created using the express-generator, this static website uses the Pug templating engine.
